## 1. Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the website developed for Nanhe Kadam Society NGO. The website aims to increase awareness about the NGO's mission, facilitate donations, encourage volunteer engagement, and provide information about the organization's programs and activities.

## 2. Website Structure

The website consists of six main pages:

1. Home (index.html)
2. About (about.html)
3. Volunteer (volunteer.html)
4. Donate (donate.html)
5. Location (location.html)
6. Contact (contact.html)

Each page is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, adhering to modern web design principles.

## 3. HTML Structure

### Common Elements

All pages share a common structure:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- `<html>` tag with `lang="en"` attribute
- `<head>` section containing metadata, title, and CSS link
- `<body>` containing the main content

#### Header

The header is consistent across all pages and includes:

- NGO branding (name and logo)
- Navigation menu

#### Footer

A simple footer with copyright information is present on all pages.

### Page-Specific Content

Each page has unique content within the `<main>` section, typically structured with:

- `<section>` elements for different content areas
- `<article>` for main content
- `<aside>` for sidebar content (where applicable)

## 4. CSS Styling

The website uses a single CSS file (`styles.css`) for consistent styling across all pages. Key styling features include:

### Layout

- Use of `float` for layout in larger screens
- `width` percentages for responsive design
- `box-sizing: border-box` for predictable sizing

### Typography

- Sans-serif font family (Roboto) for modern look
- Responsive font sizes using `em` and `rem` units
- Text shadows for enhanced readability on image backgrounds

### Color Scheme

- Primary colors: #35424a (dark blue-gray), #e8491d (orange-red)
- White (#ffffff) for contrast and readability
- Light gray (#f4f4f4) for background

### Components

- Styled buttons with hover effects
- Form input styling for consistency
- Box shadows and border-radius for modern, subtle 3D effect

## 5. Responsive Design

The website employs several techniques for responsive design:

- Fluid grid using percentage widths
- Media queries to adjust layout for smaller screens
- Flexible images using max-width: 100%
- Stack elements vertically on smaller screens

A key breakpoint is set at 768px, where significant layout changes occur.
