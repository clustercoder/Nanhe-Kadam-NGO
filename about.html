                <p>Nanhe Kadam Society NGO was established four years ago by Mrs. Renu Bhatia with a noble mission to support children orphaned due to COVID-19. Our goal is to ensure these children are provided with the best opportunities for education and growth.</p>
                <p>From our humble beginnings with just two children, we have grown to nurture around 250 kids. We provide them not only with education but also with nutritious meals, celebrate various occasions, and engage them in activities essential for their overall development.</p>
                <p>Our dedicated team works tirelessly to create a nurturing environment where these children can thrive, learn, and build a brighter future for themselves.</p>
